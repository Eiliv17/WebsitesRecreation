# Edge One Landing Page

[![Design Image](readme/cd52d7105051993.5f70d0d1f1bea.png)](https://www.behance.net/gallery/105051993/Edge_One-landing-page?tracking_source=search_projects%7Clanding+page)

I've implemented the following design using only HTML and CSS, some elements needed Javascript like the map and also some images might not be the same since i didn't find them.

The website is fully responsive, I've used a desktop-first methodology and build media queries for mobile.
